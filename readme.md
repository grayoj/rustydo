# Rustydo

A simple rust todo application adapted from <a>FreecodeCamp</a> in order to learn rust, but as sad as it seems I may not touch it again.

## Requirements
- Rust.
- Cargo.
- Rust Toolchain.

## Setup
- Clone. Run: `git clone https://github.com/grayoj/rustydo.git`
- Update packages: `sudo apt update`
- Install rustup: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
- Run the default installation.
- Include rust on your machine's path `sudo source "$HOME/.cargo/env"`
- Verify your installation `rustc -V`

## Running the Program

To run the program from your terminal:
```shell
cd rustydo/ && cargo run
```

This should compile and run the program for you.
